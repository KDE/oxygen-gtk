1/ Directories:
---------------

rc/ contains 'default' configuration files
src/ contains all the source code.
src/animations/ contains code needed for hover/focus effects, and will contain code for smooth animations
it connects to various widgets signals and events to setup and trigger widget updates when adequate conditions are fullfilled.

2/ some details on some files in src/
-------------------------------------

oxygenrcstyle:
oxygenstylewrapper: 
are the core gtk style files. Oxygenstylewrapper wraps all gtk painting calls to oxygenstyle singleton painting class.

oxygenstyle:
does all the painting, as called by oxygenstylewrapper

oxygenstylehelper: 
contains some lower level painting classes, that depend on cairo context, and not on gtk windows/widgets any more. It is also responsible for generating the tilesets.

oxygentileset:
stores 3x3 pixmap array to handle scalable widgets, similar to what kde/plasma does (as well as oxygen-qt)
they can be cached.

oxygentilesetcache: MRU tilesets cache, for optimization

oxygenwindowmanager: handles window grabbing

oxygenrgba:
stores rgba color representation and has some conversion utility functions

oxygencolorutils:
all color handling, used to shade, mix, blend, etc. It is based on code in oxygen-qt and kde/kdelibs/kdeui kcolorutils and kcolorscheme.

oxygenpalette: 
internal storage of colors. It extends the colors used by gdk and passed via gtkstyle

oxygenqtsettings:
does all the handling of Qt/Kde options, and conversion to gtk options where needed

oxygengtkicons:
is responsible for mapping/replacing gtk icons by oxygen icons. This is largely inspired from QtCurve-gtk

utility files/classes:
oxygengeometry.h: some low-level geometry classes
oxygencairocontext: a self-freed wrapper around cairo_context_t;
oxygencairopattern: a self-freed wrapper around cairo_pattern_t;
oxygencache: some stl based implementation of a fifo cache and a mru cache;
oxygencairoutils: some cairo/gdk-cairo utilities 
oxygengtkdetail: wrapper around the 'detail' strings passed to painting routines
oxygengtkutils: some widget/window ancestry tree navigation utility functions.
oxygenflags: generic utility class to handle enumeration based bit patterns.
oxygentaboptions: stores options relevant for tab rendering in notebooks
oxygenstyleoptions: stores generic options for widget rendering, based on their state, shadow, etc.

3/ some details on some files in animations/
--------------------------------------------

All types of animations (mostly mouse-over effects for the moment) have two classes:
- a Data class, that stores widget specific information on a per widget bases
- an Engine class, that collects all Data objects and map them to their matching GtkWidget. When a GtkWidget is destroyed, the corresponding entry in the map is removed. 

All engine are stored inside the oxygenanimations class.
All engines must derive from Oxygen::BaseEngine, to be stored inside Animations.
For convenience and to minimize redundant code, an Oxygen::GenericEngine class is used as a base class for most engines.

For a "Data" object to be used in an engine, it must contain a "::connect(GtkWidget*)" and a "::disconnect(GtkWidget*)" class. 
These two methods are responsible for the initialization and clean-up of the Data object.

utility files/classes:
oxygendatamap: 
keeps track of association between widgets and data objects. It also keep track of the last accessed widget, in case it is re-used immediately; for optimization.

oxygentimer:
a convenience class to handle delayed actions.

oxygensignal: 
a convenience class to handle signal/callback connections.
