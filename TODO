This is the oxygen-gtk TODO list, maintained and updated by the devs.
You can add anything you can think of here. Possibly specifying the branch, a possible release target, and a priority.
You can also add your name on which of the item you are either already working on, or interested in working on.

Reminder: fixing existing bugs on bugs.kde.org should always have the highest priority :)

argb branch:
- remove Oxygen::OptionMenuEngine::Data/Engine, since it is obsoleted by the ArgbHelper class. DONE
- add hooks to deal with combobox/comboboxentry list resize. DONE
- also add hooks for GtkCombo list resize. DONE.

- try find a way to avoid flicker (not sure whether this actually is possible or not).

main branch:

- merge the argb branch when stable enough.

- test the style with a Right-To-Left layout.

After asking Craig D, there is no way to test without actually installing a right-to-left locale, and see whats wrong.
I foresee _many_ issues:
- menuItemRect (shade in presence of submenus is on the wrong size) DONE
- GtkSpinButton
- GtkComboBox
- GtkComboBoxEntry

- add hooks at widget realization for registration to the relevant engines, rather than having it scattered in stylewrapper

- implement smooth animations (notably hover and focus smooth glow)

- try implement some "true" inner-shadow (and glow) for GtkListView

- better support for using oxygen-gtk in a non-kde environment.
