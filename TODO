This is the oxygen-gtk TODO list, maintained and updated by the devs. 
You can add anything you can think of here. Possibly specifying the branch, a possible release target, and a priority.
You can also add your name on which of the item you are either already working on, or interested in working on. 

Reminder: fixing existing bugs on bugs.kde.org should always have the highest priority :)

argb branch:
- remove Oxygen::OptionMenuEngine::Data/Engine, since it is obsoleted by the ArgbHelper class

main branch:
- add hooks to deal with combobox/comboboxentry list resize.
- add hooks at widget realization for registration to the relevant engines, rather than having it scattered in stylewrapper

- implement smooth animations (notably hover and focus smooth glow)
- try implement some "true" inner-shadow (and glow) for GtkListView
- better support for using oxygen-gtk in a non-kde environment.

- merge the argb branch when stable enough.
